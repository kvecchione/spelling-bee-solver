# Spelling Bee Solver

Solver for NYT Spelling Bee game. Obviously I like not using this when I play (cheating), but it was fun to figure out the method to solve it in code.

## Usage Example

```
# python3 spelling-bee-solver.py Abcdefg
CABBAGED [8]
DEBAGGED [8]
ACCEDED [7]
BAGGAGE [7]
CABBAGE [7]
DEFACED [7]
EFFACED [7]
FEEDBAG [7]
ACCEDE [6]
...
```
